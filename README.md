A ifttt-like toolkit, which could help you backup your resources easily.

### Usage

Create a config.js as following:
```
var config = {
    consumer_key: '',
    consumer_secret: '',
    access_token: '',
    access_token_secret: '',
    ever_token: ''
};

module.exports = config;
```
and put on your personal twitter/evernote token. Then start up the program, it will backup all your favorite tweet to evernote. Maybe will add Pocket support in the future. Cause this is personal usage, please don't ask me to implement extra features. If you also need this then take it, or you could write a familiar one. :p
